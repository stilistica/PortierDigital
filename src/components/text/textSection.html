        Think of it this way: There are two kinds of failure. The first comes
        from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or because you
        are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can never
        learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The second kind comes
        from a bold and venturesome spirit.
      </li>
      <li class="sec-text__text-item">
        If you fail in this way, the hit that you take to your reputation is
        greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated failure will toughen your
        spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done.

        In the future, the great division will be between those who have trained
        themselves to handle these complexities and those who are overwhelmed by
        them -- those who can acquire skills and discipline their minds and
        those who are irrevocably distracted by all the media around them and
        can enver focus enough to learn.

        We are all in search of feeling more connected to realityâ€”to other
        people, the times we live in, the natural world, our character, and our
        own uniqueness. Our culture increasingly tends to separate us from these
        realities in various ways.

      <li class="sec-text__text-item">
        We indulge in drugs or alcohol, or engage in dangerous sports or risky
        behavior, just to wake ourselves up from the sleep of our daily
        existence and feel a heightened sense of connection to reality. In the
        end, however, the most satisfying and powerful way to feel this
        connection is through creative activity.
      </li>
      <li class="sec-text__text-item">
        Engaged in the creative process we feel more alive than ever, because we
        are making something and not merely consuming, Masters of the small
        reality we create. In doing this work, we are in fact creating
        ourselves.
